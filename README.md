# Simon Color Game

## Overview

The **Simon Color Game** is a memory-based game that challenges players to remember and repeat a sequence of colors in the correct order. The sequence gets progressively longer as the player advances through the levels. The goal of the game is to test and improve your memory by pressing the colored buttons in the correct order based on the sequence provided by the game.

## How to Play (Step-by-Step)

1. When you press any key on the keyboard, the game will start, and the first color in the sequence will flash.
2. After the sequence flashes, click the buttons in the same order that the game displayed.
3. If you press the correct color in the right order, the game will move to the next level, adding one more color to the sequence.
4. If you make a mistake, the game will end, showing your score (the current level number).
5. After the game ends, you can press any key to restart.

## Example:

1. The game flashes **Red**.
2. You repeat by clicking **Red**.
3. The game flashes **Red** and then **Yellow**.
4. You repeat by clicking **Red** and then **Yellow**.
5. The game flashes **Red**, **Yellow**, and then **Purple**.
6. You repeat by clicking **Red**, **Yellow**, and **Purple**.

As the levels increase, the sequence gets longer, and the game becomes more challenging.
